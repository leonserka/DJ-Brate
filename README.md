# DJ Brate - AI-Powered Spotify Playlist Generator

> A full-stack web application that reads your mood, understands your taste, and builds the perfect playlist using Spotify + AI.

---

## Project Overview

DJ Brate is a student college project built as a full-stack web application. Users describe how they're feeling - by writing a free prompt, selecting a mood, picking genres, or adjusting energy sliders - and the app uses the **Spotify API** combined with an **AI layer** to generate personalized playlists, suggest songs, and build listening statistics over time.

The project integrates **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to allow the AI model to directly interact with Spotify as a tool, making suggestions dynamic and context-aware rather than rule-based.

## Features

### Mood & Preference Input

1. Write a free-text prompt to describe what you want
2. Select a mood from predefined tags (happy, sad, energetic, focused, chill, romantic) as an alternative to typing
3. Pick genres and set energy level via sliders for more precise control

### Spotify Integration

4. OAuth 2.0 login - users connect their real Spotify account securely
5. Reads the user's top tracks and listening history to personalize suggestions
6. Generates a playlist using Spotify's Recommendations API based on mood-mapped audio parameters
7. Saves the generated playlist directly to the user's Spotify library
8. Plays 30-second song previews inside the app

### AI-Powered Suggestions

9. AI interprets the user's prompt and maps it to Spotify audio feature targets (valence, energy, tempo, danceability)
10. Automatically generates a playlist name and description based on the detected mood
11. Learns from user feedback - liked and skipped tracks improve future suggestions
12. Uses MCP to let the AI call Spotify tools dynamically as part of its reasoning, rather than following static rules

### Statistics & Analytics Dashboard

13. Mood history visualized over time with charts
14. Top genres and artists broken down per mood state
15. Listening pattern analysis - energy and valence trends across sessions
